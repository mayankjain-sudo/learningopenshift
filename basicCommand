Displaying the Logs of OpenShift Nodes.TheCRI-O container engine and the Kubelet, which are Systemd units.
# oc adm node-logs -u crio my-node-name

Opening a Shell Prompt on an OpenShift Node
# oc debug node/my-node-name
sh-4.4# chroot /host
sh-4.4# systemctl is-active kubelet

From an oc debug node session, use the crictl command to get low-level information about all local containers running on the node
# oc debug node/my-node-name
  sh-4.4# chroot /host
  sh-4.4# crictl ps

Listing events from the current project 
#  oc get events

Troubleshooting Running and Terminated Pods
#  oc logs my-pod-name

If the pod contains multiple containers, then the oc logs command requires the -c option
# oc logs my-pod-name -c my-container-name

Creating Troubleshooting Pods
# oc debug deployment/my-deployment-name --as-root

Changing a Running Container
The following commands help with making changes to running containers. They all assume that pods contain a single container. If not, you must add the -c my-container-name option.
# oc rsh my-pod-name
	Opens a shell inside a pod to run shell commands interactively and non-interactively.
# oc cp /local/path my-pod-name:/container/path
	Copies local files to a location inside a pod. You can also reverse arguments and copy files
	from inside a pod to your local file system. See also the oc rsync command for copying
	multiple files at once
# oc port-forward my-pod-name local-port:remote-port
	Creates a TCP tunnel from local-port on your workstation to local-port on the pod.
	The tunnel is alive as long as you keep the oc port-forward running. This allows you to get
	network access to the pod without exposing it through a route. Because the tunnel starts at
	your localhost, it cannot be accessed by other machines.

Troubleshooting OpenShift CLI Commands
The --loglevel level option displays OpenShift API requests, starting with level 6. As you
increase the level, up to 10, more information about those requests is added, such as their HTTP
request headers and response bodies. Level 10 also includes a curl command to replicate each
request.
# oc get pod --loglevel 6
# oc get pod --loglevel 10

Authentication token that the oc command uses to authenticate OpenShift API requests to get your token, use the -t option of the oc whoami command
# oc whoami -t
